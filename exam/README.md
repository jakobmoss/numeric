**Project:** 9. Inverse iteration for eigenvalues

Exercise
---------
### A
* Implement the inverse iteration method for determining eigenvalues and -vectors.
This algorithm should converge towards the eigenvalue of least magnitude.
* Implement the inverse iteration method with a shift and check that you are
able to find all eigenvalues of a given matrix (compare with a library routine)
