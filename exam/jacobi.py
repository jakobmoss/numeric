    Performs matrix diagonalization (on a real and symmetric matrix)
    using the Jacobi eigenvalue method; solving for one eigenvalue at
    a time. This algorithm zeros out one row at a time, always
    eliminating the greatest off-diagonal element.

    Returns the number of rotations used.

    Arguments:
    - `A`: Real, symmetric input matrix to diagonalize. Upper triangle
           is destroyed.
    - `d`: Empty target vector. The eigenvalues are stored here.
    - `V`: Empty target matrix. The corresponding eigenvectors are
           stored here.
