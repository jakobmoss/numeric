 ** Integrating cos(x)*sin(y) from (x,y) = (-pi/2,0) to (pi/2,pi) ** 
Exact solution = 4
- Plain Monte Carlo integration:
Sampling (N):  = 1000
Integral       = 3.983448294675703
Error estimate = 8.93893e-02
Actual error   = 1.65517e-02

A plot of how the error scales with N is shown in plot.A.pdf (the data is kept in Aerr.dat)
