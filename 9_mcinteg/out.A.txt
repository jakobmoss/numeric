 ** Integrating cos(x)*sin(y) from (x,y) = (-pi/2,0) to (pi/2,pi) ** 
Exact solution = 4
- Plain Monte Carlo integration:
Sampling (N):  = 1000
Integral       = 3.995045787703318
Error estimate = 9.03537e-02
Actual error   = 4.95421e-03

A plot of how the error scales with N is shown in plot.A.pdf (the data is kept in Aerr.dat)
